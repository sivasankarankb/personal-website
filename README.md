# personal-website
Siva's personal website. Pages are written by hand in simple HTML5. Styling is
done with Tailwind CSS. Build process is done with `gulp.js` .

## Building
1. Install Node.js. I run v22. Any recent version should work.

2. Clone this repo and open a terminal window pointing to it

3. Install dependencies with `npm install`

4. Create dir `src/images`

5. Build the site with `npx gulp` (files are output to dir `dist`)

## Where are the Images?

While I could store images and other binary files in this repo, it may be
inefficient in the long run. I've put them up on Google Drive
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eLMkVJuD0WgddytU_zek4h3gq8XFoyPl).

## License

I want my code to be as useful to people as possible. On the other hand, as per
my plans so far, this repo will also contain original text, artwork and other
media of my own creation. I would like to retain the rights to that.

1. Plain text, images and icons in this repo and all content in the Google
   Drive assets folder linked in the *"Where are the Images?"* section are:
   ```

   If you would like to reuse significant portions of my text content or any of
   my images, icons or other media, feel free to contact me. You can find the
   most up to date contact info on the about page of my website.
