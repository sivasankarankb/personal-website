# personal-website
Siva's personal website. Pages are written by hand in simple HTML5. Styling is
done with Tailwind CSS. Build process is done with `gulp.js` .

## Building
1. Install Node.js. I run v22. Any recent version should work.

2. Clone this repo and open a terminal window pointing to it

3. Install dependencies with `npm install`

4. Create dir `src/images`

5. Build the site with `npx gulp` (files are output to dir `dist`)

## Where are the Images?

While I could store images and other binary files in this repo, it may be
inefficient in the long run. I will put them up somewhere else and link to
that below at a later date.
