                I was born in a village in Thrissur, Kerala. I still live
                there. My parents are well educated farmers. They tell me that
                I used to break my toys, curious about their inner workings.
                They also tell me I was fond of the English language.

                I did my schooling at a CBSE school near home. I was top of my
                class in Computer Science. I got into HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                Java and C/C++ while at school. I also used to write a little
                hobby x86 Operating System back then.

            <p class="text-justify">
                I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering
                from a private college near home.  While there, I got into
                Python. I competed in a few local coding contests at college
                Tech Fests and even won some of them. I also worked at two
                startups, the second of which turned into my first real job.
